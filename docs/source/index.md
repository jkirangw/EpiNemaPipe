# EpigeneNemaPipe

EpigeneNemaPipe is a pipeline for analysis of chromatin state changes
in the nematode *Strongyloides ratti*. The pipeline uses two unsupervised
machine learning techniques to segment the genome.

The chromatin states are learned from binarized data using a multivariate
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN).
