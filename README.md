# EpigeneNemaPipe
EpigeneNemaPipe is pipeline for analysis of chromatin state changes in nematode Strongyloides ratti. The pipeline uses two unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment the genome. 
The chromatin states are learned from this binarized data using a multivariate Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Dynamic Bayesian network (DBN).
